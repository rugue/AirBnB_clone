# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

The AirBnB console is about creating a minishell; it works in both interactive and non-interactive modes; this project is simply a copy of the AirBnB website.


## Command interpreter or console

The first step is to manage a powerful storage system. This storage engine will provide an abstraction between "My Object" and "How They Are Stored and Persisted." This means you will not have to worry about how your objects are stored in your console code (the command interpreter) or the front-end and RestAPI you will create later.

## How to Start It:
To start the console, run the following command:./console.py.

## How to use:
Manage objects (create, update, destroy, etc) via a console / command interpreter.
Store and save objects to a file (JSON file).
Commands: create, show, destroy, all (displays all), update, help, quit.
### Example of how to open:
$
./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):

EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
